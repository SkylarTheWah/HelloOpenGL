# HelloOpenGL

Here is my first ever OpenGL C++ project. Hope you enjoy :3
ATM only developing on Windows (sorry Linux!) I may learn how to use CMake and therefore distribute GLFW3 sources in this project in the future but I do not daily drive Linux at this point. I am following this tutorial: [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)
